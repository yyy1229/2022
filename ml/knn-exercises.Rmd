## Exercises 
1\. Earlier we used logistic regression to predict sex from height. Use kNN to do the same. Use the code described in this chapter to select the $F_1$ measure and plot it against $k$. Compare to the $F_1$ of about 0.6 we obtained with regression. 
2\. Load the following dataset: 
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
data("tissue_gene_expression") 
``` 
This dataset includes a matrix `x`:  
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
dim(tissue_gene_expression$x) 
``` 
with the gene expression measured on 500 genes for 189 biological samples representing seven different tissues. The tissue type is stored in `y`: 
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
table(tissue_gene_expression$y) 
``` 
Split the data in training and test sets, then use kNN to predict tissue type and see what accuracy you obtain. Try it for  $k = 1, 3, \dots, 11$.
