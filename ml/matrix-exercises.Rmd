## Exercises 
1\. Create a 100 by 10 matrix of randomly generated normal numbers. Put the result in `x`. 
2\. Apply the three R functions that give you the dimension of `x`, the number of rows of `x`, and the number of columns of `x`, respectively. 
3\. Add the scalar 1 to row 1, the scalar 2 to row 2, and so on, to the matrix `x`. 
4\. Add the scalar 1 to column 1, the scalar 2 to column 2, and so on, to the matrix `x`. Hint: use `sweep` with `FUN = "+"`. 
5\. Compute the average of each row of `x`. 
6\. Compute the average of each column of `x`. 
7\. For each digit in the MNIST training data, compute the proportion of pixels that are in a _grey area_, defined as values between 50 and 205.  
Make boxplot by digit class. Hint: use logical operators and `rowMeans`.
