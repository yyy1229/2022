## Exercises 
1\. Load the following dataset: 
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
data("tissue_gene_expression") 
``` 
This dataset includes a matrix `x`  
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
dim(tissue_gene_expression$x) 
``` 
with the gene expression measured on 500 genes for 189 biological samples representing seven different tissues. The tissue type is stored in `y` 
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
table(tissue_gene_expression$y) 
``` 
Compute the distance between each observation and store it in an object `d`. 
2\. Compare the distance between the first two observations (both cerebellums), the 39th and 40th (both colons), and the 73rd and 74th (both endometriums). See if the observations of the same tissue type are closer to each other. 
3\. We see that indeed observations of the same tissue type are closer to each other in the six tissue examples we just examined. Make a plot of all the distances using the `image` function to see if this pattern is general. Hint: convert `d` to a matrix first.
