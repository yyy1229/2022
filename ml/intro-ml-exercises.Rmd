## Exercises 
1\. For each of the following, determine if the outcome is continuous or categorical: 
a. Digit reader 
b. Movie recommendations 
c. Spam filter 
d. Hospitalizations 
e. Siri (speech recognition) 
2\. How many features are available to us for prediction in the digits dataset? 
3\. In the digit reader example, the outcomes are stored here: 
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
library(dslabs) 
mnist <- read_mnist() 
y <- mnist$train$labels 
``` 
Do the following operations have a practical meaning? 
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
y[5] + y[6] 
y[5] > y[6] 
``` 
Pick the best answer: 
a. Yes, because $9 + 2 = 11$ and $9 > 2$. 
b. No, because `y` is not a numeric vector. 
c. No, because 11 is not a digit. It's two digits. 
d. No, because these are labels representing a category not a number. A `9` represents a class not the number 9.
